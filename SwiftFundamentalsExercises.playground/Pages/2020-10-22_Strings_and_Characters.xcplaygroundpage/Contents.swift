//Question 1
//Write code that prints out all the numbers from 1 to 10 as a single string.
var numStr = ""
for num in 1...10 {
    numStr = numStr + " " + String(num)

    if number % 2 == 0 {

//Question 3
//Write code that prints out every number ending in 4 between 1 and 60 as a single string.

//Question 4
//Print each character in the string "Hello world!"
//var helloStr : String = "Hello world!"
//for char in helloStr {
//    print(char)
//}

//Question 5
//Print out the last character in the string below. You cannot use the Character literal "!" (i.e you must access myStringSeven's characters).

 Question 6
 You are given a string stored in the variable aString. Create new string named replacedString that contains the characters of the original string with all the occurrences of the character "e" replaced by "*".
 
 var aString = "Replace the letter e with *"
 // Your code here
 Example:
 
 Input: let aString = "Replace the letter e with *"
 
 Expected values: replacedString = "R*plac* th* l*tt*r * with *"

//You are given a string stored in variable aString. Create a new string called reverse that contains the original string in reverse order. Print the reversed string. You cannot used built-in reverse.

 Question 8
 You are given a string stored in variable aString. Print true if aString is a palindrome, and false otherwise. A palindrome is a string which reads the same backward or forward.

 Example 1: Input: let str1 = "anutforajaroftuna"
 Output: true
 
 Example 2: Input: let str2 = "Hello"

 Question 9
 You are given a string stored in variable problem. Write code so that you print each word of the string on a new line.

 Question 10
 You are given a string stored in variable problem. Write code that prints the longest word in the string.
